# Optimizing-fleet-utilization---analysis-and-predictions of utilization rate
Analyse the utilisation of fleet vehicles to identify underused assets and make data-driven recommendations for optimising the fleet size and composition, improving efficiency, safety and cost-effectiveness. 
# Objectives

The main objective of this project is to optimize the fleet size and composition for the City of Toronto by identifying underutilized and overutilized vehicles. The project aims to answer the following key 
## questions:

- Which vehicles are underutilized or overutilized?
- How does utilization vary across departments and times of the year?
- What is the optimal number and type of vehicles needed to meet demand?

# Methodology

The analysis focused on identifying the utilization rate of vehicles and comparing them within the same type to detect outliers. A balanced approach to fleet management was recommended, with emphasis on matching vehicle types to departmental needs and adjusting for seasonal demand.

# Key Results
## Which vehicles are underutilized or overutilized?
- Overutilized Vehicles: Heavy vehicles exhibited higher utilization rates, indicating they are frequently in demand and may require fleet expansion to meet operational needs.
- Underutilized Vehicles: Light vehicles and special equipment showed lower utilization rates, suggesting that these assets are underutilized and could be considered for downsizing or repurposing.
- Outliers: Vehicles with utilization rates significantly above or below the average for their type were identified as outliers, warranting closer inspection for potential reallocation or adjustment in fleet size.

## How does utilization vary across departments?
- High Utilization Departments: Departments such as Emergency Services and Public Works showed consistently higher vehicle utilization rates, reflecting their critical and frequent operational demands.
- Moderate to Low Utilization Departments: Departments like Administrative Services and Parks & Recreation had lower vehicle utilization rates, indicating that their fleet may be larger than necessary for their needs.
- Seasonal Variations: Utilization rates also varied seasonally, with certain departments experiencing peak demand during specific times of the year, such as increased Parks & Recreation vehicle use during summer.

## What is the optimal number and type of vehicles needed to meet demand?
- Heavy Vehicles: Given their high utilization rates, especially in departments like Emergency Services and Public Works, an increase in the number of heavy vehicles is recommended to meet the consistent and high demand.
- Light Vehicles: These vehicles showed moderate utilization. The current fleet size for light vehicles appears adequate, but minor adjustments could be made based on specific departmental needs and usage patterns.
- Special Equipment: Due to lower utilization rates, the fleet size for special equipment could be reduced or reallocated to departments where they might be more needed, optimizing the overall fleet composition.
- Balanced Fleet Strategy: A dynamic approach is recommended, adjusting the fleet composition seasonally and based on real-time demand. This ensures that each department has the right type and number of vehicles throughout the year.
