# Optimizing-fleet-utilization---analysis-and-predictions of utilization rate
Analyse the utilisation of fleet vehicles to identify underused assets and make data-driven recommendations for optimising the fleet size and composition, improving efficiency, safety and cost-effectiveness. 
# Objectives

The main objective of this project is to optimize the fleet size and composition for the City of Toronto by identifying underutilized and overutilized vehicles. The project aims to answer the following key ### questions:

- Which vehicles are underutilized or overutilized?
- How does utilization vary across departments and times of the year?
- What is the optimal number and type of vehicles needed to meet demand?

# Methodology

The analysis focused on identifying the utilization rate of vehicles and comparing them within the same type to detect outliers. A balanced approach to fleet management was recommended, with emphasis on matching vehicle types to departmental needs and adjusting for seasonal demand.

# Key Results

- Heavy vehicles should be prioritized for expansion, particularly in high-demand departments like Emergency Services and Public Works.
- Light vehicles and special equipment exhibited lower utilization, suggesting that their fleet sizes could either be maintained or slightly reduced.
- Overall, a balanced approach is essential for effective fleet management, ensuring that the fleet meets current and future demand while reducing costs and improving operational efficiency.
