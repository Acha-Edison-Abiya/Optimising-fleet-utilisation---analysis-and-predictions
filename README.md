# Optimizing-fleet-utilization---analysis-and-predictions of utilization rate
Analyse the utilisation of fleet vehicles to identify underused assets and make data-driven recommendations for optimising the fleet size and composition, improving efficiency, safety and cost-effectiveness. 
# Problem Definition
  ## Objective: 
  The objective in this project is to identify underutilized and overutilized vehicles to optimize fleet size and composition.

  Key Questions:

- Which vehicles are underutilized or overutilized? - Calculate utilization rate, Compared vehicles of the same type to identify outliers (either underutilized or overutilized).
- How does utilization vary across departments and times of the year?
- What is the optimal number and type of vehicles needed to meet demand?
